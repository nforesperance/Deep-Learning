Deep Learning and neural network


#### **Note**
1. The files in the home folder are acording to the [(https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorials/)](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorials/) 2016 Machine Learning course. Its a kind of a from scratch tutorial!
Rest of tututorial sample code here **[Here!](#https://github.com/pissall20/neural-networks)**
2. The tim folder has sample codes for training and running with keras based on [https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-neural-networks/](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-neural-networks/) Tensor flow tutorial.
